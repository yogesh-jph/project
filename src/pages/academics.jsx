The central aim of the course is to prepare students for the practice of theatre. 
To this end a variety of practical skills must be developed and a corpus of knowledge acquired. While all areas of study are assessed separately and a high standard of work demanded in each, the most important intention of the course is the development of the intangible concept of creative imagination and its expression within the collective framework of a group.
