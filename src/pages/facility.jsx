        <p class="text-left text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-7 ml-10   mr-10"><b className="text-red-800">Workshops</b> - In recent years, NSD under its Extension Programme organized a series of theatre workshops in the North Eastern States. The workshops proceeded on the basis of a 3-step programme – the first was to arouse interest amongst all participants about the intricacies of the theatre experience – performance and transference; the second was to impart training in the area and the third was to help and guide them to prepare productions on the basis of the received training. The first Poorvottar Natya Samaroh was organized in Guwahati in 2007 and the second at Gangtok, Sikkim in 2008.

Regional Resource Centres - With a view to take the theatre movement to the grass root level and to make it more accessible to theatre workers, it was decided to decentralize the Extension Programme and set up Regional Resource Centres in various zones of the country. The first such centre, covering the states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry, was set up in Bangalore in 1994. The Centre has been very active and has organized quite a large number of workshops in collaboration with State agencies and local theatre groups.

<b className="text-red-800 text-size-12">Trainings</b> - Training in the School is unique in several ways. It is based on a thorough, comprehensive and carefully-planned syllabus that covers every aspect of theatre from theory to practice, the results of which  are put to test before a wide audience. The syllabus takes into account the methods of great theatre personalities who have shaped contemporary theatre in all its forms and expressions. Training includes broad-based training in classical Indian and western dramatic traditions, Indian traditional and folk theatre, modern theatre trends in India and abroad, introduction of theatre trends of the world, and specialized training in Indian theatre traditions.

Reservation for candidates belonging to SC/ST/OBC categories - Out of 20 seats, 4 seats are reserved for SC/ST/OBC candidates, preferably those from families traditionally belonging to the performing arts.

Provision of admission for foreign students - Foreign students, preferably from the neighbouring countries, may be admitted to the course. However, because of the limited number of seats, it is not feasible to accommodate more than 1-2 foreign students in one session. Such students have to submit their applications through the Indian Embassy/High Commission, who will forward these to the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. The School will then consider the applications recommended by the I.C.C.R.

Recognition of the course - The Diploma in Dramatics awarded by the School has been recognized by the Government of India (erstwhile Ministry of Education and Culture) for the purpose of recruitment to superior posts and services under the Central Government, where specialization is required in the field of Dramatics. The Diploma is equal to an M.A. Degree in Dramatics envisaged by the Association of Indian Universities for appointments of teachers in colleges and universities and for the registration for Ph.D.
